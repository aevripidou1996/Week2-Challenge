# Week 2 Challenge


## Description
This is my submission for my week 2 challange.

In this assignnment i was tasked with building a personal portfolio with no starter code.

As a result of this i had to develop my owne code and use methods that i have learned from the past 2 wekks at bootcamp.

These topics include advanced CSS, flexbox, media queries & positioning.

The original page was created with 1918 x 1684 resolution and the media query has been set to (max-width: 992px).
